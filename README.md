This repository contains some of the problems published on [Rosalind](rosalind.info/). The list of solved problems is far from being complete. Originally I have solved them in Python, but decided to reimplement some of them in Scala. This language is really a great fun to use, highly recommend it to anyone.

I would like to kindly ask the reader not to copy the solutions hosted here. Solving the problems are mostly not that difficult and it's worth the time that one would invest in dealing with developing a particular algorithm. It is always easier to reason about something that you have invented yourself instead of understanding a different logic used by another problem solver.

Have fun and happy coding!
